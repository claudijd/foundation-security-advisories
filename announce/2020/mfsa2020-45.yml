  CVE-2020-15969:
    title: Use-after-free in usersctp
    impact: high
    reporter: Mark Wodrich of Google
    feed: false
    description: |
      A use-after-free bug in the usersctp library was reported upstream. We assume this could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-15254:
    title: Undefined behavior in bounded channel of crossbeam rust crate
    impact: high
    reporter: Caelum van Ispelen
    feed: false
    description: |
      In the crossbeam rust crate, the bounded channel incorrectly assumed that Vec::from_iter had allocated capacity that was the same as the number of iterator elements. Vec::from_iter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumptions - this is unsound and caused a deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vec::from_iter had allocated different sizes than the number of iterator elements. The impact on Firefox is undetermined, but in another use case, the behavior was causing corruption of jemalloc structures.

  CVE-2020-15680:
    title: Presence of external protocol handlers could be determined through image tags
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Rotem Kerner
    description: |
      If a valid external protocol handler was referenced in an image tag, the resulting broken image size could be distinguished from a broken image size of a non-existent protocol handler. This allowed an attacker to successfully probe whether an external protocol handler was registered.

  CVE-2020-15681:
    title: Multiple WASM threads may have overwritten each others' stub table entries
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Alon Zakai
    description: |
      When multiple WASM threads had a reference to a module, and were looking up exported functions, one WASM thread could have overwritten another's entry in a shared stub table, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

  CVE-2020-15682:
    title: The domain associated with the prompt to open an external protocol could be spoofed to display the incorrect origin
    impact: low
    reporter: Lijo A.T.
    description: |
      When a link to an external protocol was clicked, a prompt was presented that allowed the user to choose what application to open it in. An attacker could induce that prompt to be associated with an origin they didn't control, resulting in a spoofing attack. This was fixed by changing external protocol prompts to be tab-modal while also ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different origin.

    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 82 and Firefox ESR 78.4
    impact: high
    reporter: Mozilla developers and community
    description: |
      Mozilla developers and community members Simon Giesecke, Christian Holler, Philipp, and Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

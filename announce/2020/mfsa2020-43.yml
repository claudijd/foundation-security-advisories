    title: Download origin spoofing via redirect
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Richard Thomas and Tom Chothia of University of Birmingham

  CVE-2020-15678:
    title: When recursing through layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free scenario
    impact: moderate
    reporter: Lukas Bernhard
    description: |
      When recursing through graphical layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free. This occurs because the function <code>APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds</code> did not follow iterator invalidation rules.

  CVE-2020-15673:
    title: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 81 and Firefox ESR 78.3
    impact: high
    reporter: Jason Kratzer
    description: |
      Mozilla developer Jason Kratzer reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.
